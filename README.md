# NyayGuru (Local dev)

This is a small Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold containing the NyayGuru UI you provided.

Quick start (Windows cmd.exe):

1. Install dependencies:

   cd /d D:\Academics\Projects\NyayaGuru && npm install

2. Start dev server:

   npm run dev

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- The UI includes an `API_CONFIG` object in `src/App.jsx` — set `BASE_URL` and endpoints to integrate with your backend.
- This project uses Tailwind CSS; classes in the JSX are already present.
